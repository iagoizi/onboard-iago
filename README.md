# Ariranha's Onboarding

## Project's description

This is a project created to practice technical skills during my onboarding at Instituto Taqtile. The main goal is to learn more about git, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and GraphQL.

## Environment and tools

- npm version: 6.14.4
- React version: 17.0.2
- TypeScript: 4.3.5

To set up a better and well-organized environment, we're using:

- Prettier
- ESLint

## Steps to run and debug

In this project's root folder, install all the required dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can run the project by running:

```
npm start
```

By doing that, the project will start and you can see it at http://localhost:3000. Each change made to the source code will reload the browser applying those changes.
